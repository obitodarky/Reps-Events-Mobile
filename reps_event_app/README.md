Flutter is Google's mobile app SDK for crafting high-quality native interfaces
on iOS and Android in record time. Flutter works with existing code, is used by
developers and organizations around the world, and is free and open source.

## About Flutter

We think Flutter will help you create beautiful, fast apps, with a productive,
extensible and open development model.

### Beautiful apps

We want to enable designers to deliver their full creative vision without being
forced to water it down due to limitations of the underlying framework.
Flutter's [layered architecture] gives you control over every pixel on the
screen, and its powerful compositing capabilities let you overlay and animate
graphics, video, text and controls without limitation. Flutter includes a full
[set of widgets][widget catalog] that deliver pixel-perfect experiences on both
iOS and Android.

### Fast apps

Flutter is fast. It's powered by the same hardware-accelerated [Skia] 2D
graphics library that underpins Chrome and Android. We architected Flutter to
support glitch-free, jank-free graphics at the native speed of your device.
Flutter code is powered by the world-class [Dart platform], which enables
compilation to native 32-bit and 64-bit ARM code for iOS and Android.

### Productive development

Flutter offers stateful hot reload, allowing you to make changes to your code
and see the results instantly without restarting your app or losing its state.

### Extensible and open model

Flutter works with any development tool, but includes editor plug-ins for both
[Visual Studio Code] and [IntelliJ / Android Studio]. Flutter provides
[thousands of packages][Flutter packages] to speed your development, regardless
of your target platform. And accessing platform features is easy. Here is a
snippet from our [interop example]:

```dart
Future<void> getBatteryLevel() async {
  var batteryLevel = 'unknown';
  try {
    int result = await methodChannel.invokeMethod('getBatteryLevel');
    batteryLevel = 'Battery level: $result%';
  } on PlatformException {
    batteryLevel = 'Failed to get battery level.';
  }
  setState(() {
    _batteryLevel = batteryLevel;
  });
}
```

Flutter is a fully open source project, and we welcome contributions.
